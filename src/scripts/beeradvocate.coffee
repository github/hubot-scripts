# Description:
#   An alternate to the existing beer script, this will scrape beer advocate for the most recent accessed beer.
#   It returns the name of the beer, a picture of the beer and a link to the beer. Hubot is now full of
#   different options for beer scripts. Removing the ? (optional) after (a|advocate) will force the command
#   to be 'beer advocate me' and thereby allow this script to coexist with other beer scripts peacefully.
#
# Dependencies:
#   None
#
# Configuration:
#   None
#
# Commands:
#   hubot beer advocate me - returns the latest beer discussed on beer advocate with picture
