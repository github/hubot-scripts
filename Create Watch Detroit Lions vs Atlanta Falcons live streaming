Preview:

  The Atlanta Falcons hope a strong finish to the regular season will help build enough momentum to avoid another early playoff exit.

 After earning a playoff spot last season, the reeling Detroit Lions are relegated to the role of spoilers this time.

The visiting Falcons can clinch home-field advantage throughout the NFC playoffs by handing the Lions a seventh consecutive loss Saturday night.

   "We still have some things in front of us, in terms of the regular season, that we want to accomplish and get done," said quarterback Matt Ryan, who has already broken his own team records for completions (369) and passing yards (4,202) in a season.

    Ryan was 23 of 28 for 270 yards with three touchdowns and no interceptions against the Giants. He's thrown six TDs and one pick in the last three games while posting a 102.7 passer rating - third-highest in the NFL over that span.

    "You have something to prove every week regardless of winning streak, losing streak, what happened the previous week," Lions coach Jim Schwartz said. "This is a week-to-week business. The people that keep their eyes on that, that are consistent from week to week, are the people that are successful in this league."
